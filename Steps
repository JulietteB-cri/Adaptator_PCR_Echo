Modelized with Rhinocéros 3D 6 (Mac) : Echo (96) been modelized, and PCR plate (low-profile) was substarcted from the original Echo shape, allowing to catch it and to fit into the Echo machine.

Exported in stl (ASCII Binary export)

Printed with Ultimaker 3 (with CURA) :
  0.2 mm / PLA Black / nozzle : 205 C° / No need to support / Printed with Gyroid 50% 

Remarks :

We printed with U3M - Then, we recommend to print a test (depending your 3D printer), and adapt some measurements to it.

 The adaptator need to catch the PCR plate (low-profile, 96 wells) because the machine reverse it before to enter inside. 
 Then, you need to print the adaptator perfectly fitted.
